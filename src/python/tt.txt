here’s what i’m thinking then.

for each source of law, where code like this are required, we need to create a map of identifiers to citationformats
1. what the vendor is putting the path (specifically hcontainer class attribute in the xml submissions) ->  identifier
2. line it up with corresponding the baby blue codes in a new attribute, say or citationFormat as an attribute of the enum
3. Add careful logic near sdc.py to create a dictionary of those values, save it to the section, and render it in the citation (edited)
